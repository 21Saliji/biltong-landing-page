            Biltong is a form of dried, cured meat which originated in Southern African countries (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, and Zambia). 
            Various types of meat are used to produce it, ranging from beef to game meats such as ostrich or kudu. 
            The cut may also vary being either fillets of meat cut into strips following the grain of the muscle, or flat pieces sliced across the grain.
            It is related to beef jerky; both are spiced, dried meats; however, the typical ingredients, taste, and production processes may differ.
