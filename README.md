# Find Me a Biltong Store

## Description

Welcome to **Find Me a Biltong Store**! This web app was inspired by my genuine love for biltong—a delicious, traditional South African dried meat snack. I know there’s a vibrant community out there who appreciates biltong just as much as I do, and I wanted to create a space where fellow enthusiasts can learn more about it and, most importantly, easily find places to buy it.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for the structure of the site
- **CSS** – for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – for interactivity and dynamic features
